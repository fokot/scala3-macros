 *
 * Scala 3's reflection capabilities offer a much deeper introspection into `Type`s and `Expr`s as
 * `TypeRepr`s and `Term`s, being the low-level AST elements that are used throughout the compiler.

   * EXERCISE 4 (45 mins)

   * Let's try constructing a new tree. Imagine we have a partial function implemented with a
   * pattern match over several cases, all of which are literal strings. Naively, the scrutinee
   * will be compared to each case in turn, until a match is found.
   *
   * But what if we could map every case by a single small, precomputed integer? The compiler could
   * optimize the pattern match as a "jump" in bytecode without trying to match on every case.
   * (We would have to accept that unexpected input might result in a match.)
   *
   * The high-level steps needed to implement this macro are as follows:
   *
   * 1. Convert the `fn` expression to a term and use pattern matching to get the `CaseDef`s
   * 2. Find all the `CaseDef`s that are string literals, and convert it to a `Map[String, Term]`
   * 3. Calculate a hash function that disambiguates every key in the map (see below).
   * 4. Construct new `CaseDef`s matching the integer of the hashed keys, and put these back into
   *    the original `PartialFunction` - this is fine because its type allows `Int` keys, but
   *    requires copying parts of the original tree.
   * 5. Convert the new `PartialFunction` to an `Expr` with `asExprOf[...]`, and use a quoted block
   *    to `compose` it with a function which computes the the hash key from the `String` input.
   *
   * There are several ways we could compute a hash function for the input, with a lot of room for
   * optimization. We will use a simple approach:
   *
   * 1. Take the `hashCode` of all the `String`s, and take the absolute value (so it's positive)
   * 2. Starting with the `n`, the number of keys we have, calculate each key's hashcode modulo `n`
   * 3. Keep adding `1` to `n` until every key maps to a different value.
   *
   * Note that this does not scale well for large numbers of keys! But we are optimizing
   * time at runtime over time at compile-time and space at runtime.

/**
 * Type Representations
 *
 * A `TypeRepr` is a representation of a type we can inspect as a datatype, much like `Term` is a
 * datatype we can inspect, representing terms. Here's the relationship between the four
 * types representing types and terms and the quotes and reflection APIs
 *              
 *                | quotes API | reflect API
 *    ------------+------------+-------------
 *    term space  | Expr[T]    | Term
 *    type space  | Type[T]    | TypeRepr
 *
 * The meaning of type parameters (or their absence) is important, particularly for the distinction
 * between `Type[T]` and `TypeRepr`.
 *
 * - a `Type[T]` always corresponds to a type `T` that is in scope (but in the type namespace)
 * - a `Type[T]` object is not useful (and doesn't make sense) without `T`
 * - if we have a `Type[T]`, then we must have some `T` type we can use in type positions, even if
 *   that type is abstract
 * - a pattern match which binds a new type, say `t`, creates a new scope with both the type `t`
 *   AND a contextual `Type[t]` instance; the type is abstract, but can still be composed in
 *   types, etc
 * - a `TypeRepr` has no type parameter, so there's no immediate way to use it in type position
 * - but it is "just" a data structure
 * - there is overview of the hierarchy of `TypeRepr`s in the Dotty source code:
 *   `github.com:lampepfl/dotty/library/src/scala/quoted/Quotes.scala`
 *
 * To convert between them, use:
 *  - `expr.asTerm`
 *  - `term.asExpr` or `term.asExprOf[T]`
 *  - `typeRepr.asType`
 *  - `TypeRepr.of[T]` given a contextual `Type[T]` in scope

   * Now use tab-completion in Metals to see the members of `TypeRepr`. Ignore the methods which
   * use `Symbol`s for now (we will experiment with these in the next exercise), and experiment with
   * some of the other methods. In particular, try the following:
   *
   * - check whether a type is a type of function with `isFunctionType`

   * - check a subtype relationship with another `TypeRepr` with `<:<`
   * - get a list of type parameters with `typeArgs`
   * - widening a singleton type with `widen`
   * - resolving a type alias with `de-alias`

   * We can't use `summon[SchemaType[str, ?]]` in the macro because we don't have the string
   * available as a singleton type when the macro is expanding. We only have it as a runtime value.

   *
   * We want to write `Expr.summon[SchemaType[str, ?]]`, but we still need `str` as a type in scope!

   * representing a singleton literal `String` type from just a runtime string.
   * 
   * So, in the macro,
   *   1. create a new `ConstantType` of the type name (which is a `TypeRepr`
   *   2. convert it to a `Type[?]`
   *   3. pattern match on it using `'[...]`
   *   4. use `Expr.summon` to do an implicit search for a `SchemaType` with the appropriate
   *      parameters. Note that if the compiler says that it can't prove that type A conforms to
   *      type B, but we know that it does, then we can write `A & B` in place of `A`. If it really
   *      is true that `A <: B`, then `A & B` and `A` are _identical_ types anyway.
   *   5. pattern match on the result of `Expr.summon`, and handle the failure case with an error
   *   6. pattern match the successful result of Expr.summon with,
   *      ```
   *      case Some('{ ${_}: schemaType }) => Type.of[schemaType] match
   *        case '[SchemaType[?, fieldType]] =>

   * We can then represent quantities with instances of the class,
   * `case class Quantity[U <: UnitType](value: Double)`
   *
   * Note that `Quantity`'s type parameter is invariant.
   *
   * We can define arithmetic operations on `Quantity`. Addition and subtraction are easy, because
   * the type system can already enforce the constraint that the two operands have the same type,
   * and hence the same units:
   * ```
   * def +(right: Quantity[U]): Quantity[U] = Quantity[U](value + right.value)
   * def -(right: Quantity[U]): Quantity[U] = Quantity[U](value - right.value)
   * ```
   *
   * The implementations of `*` and `/` are where it gets interesting!
   *
   * We will need to use a macros, and since the resultant type may be neither of the input types,
   * we know that it will need to be a `transparent` macro which computes its own type.
   * ```
   * def *[V <: UnitType](right: Quantity[V]): Quantity[UnitType] = ???
   * def /[V <: UnitType](right: Quantity[V]): Quantity[UnitType] = ???
   * ```
   *
   * Let's focus on `*` to begin with. Here's a stub:
   * ```
   * transparent inline def *[V <: UnitType](right: Quantity[V]): Any = ???
   * ```
   *
   * Leave the return type as `Any`. Why not `Quantity[UnitType]`?
   *
   * To implement this, let's take the following steps:
   *
   * 1. Pass both `U` and `V` to the macro, with `Type` contextual values
   * 2. Get the `TypeRepr`s for these types deconstruct each recursively into a `Map[TypeRef, Int]`
   *    We will need to use the pattern extractors, `AppliedType`, `TypeRef`, `ConstantType`,
   *    `IntConstant` and `AndType`.
   * 3. Combine the two maps by adding together the values for matching `TypeRef` keys, and
   *    removing any keys with value `0` after addition.
   * 4. Construct a new `TypeRepr` recursively from the keys and values in the `Map`, and convert
   *    this to a `Type`, `q`.
   * 5. Use quotes to instantiate a new `Expr[Quantity[q]]`, with the product of the double values
   *    from the two operands. N.B. The compiler doesn't know that `q` conforms to `UnitType`, but
   *    we know that `q & UnitType` does, and it's safe to write this type.
   * 8. Handle the case where all the units have the power `0` -- and just return a raw `Double`!
   * 7. The implementation of `/` is very similar -- try to implement it without copy/pasting the
   *    entire macro!
   * 8. Now, create extension methods, `*` and `/` on `Double` which take a `Quantity` instance and
   *    Return a new `Quantity`. (These do not need to be macros.)
   *
   * Now try out the macro in `playground.scala`. Try the following:
   *
   * - define unit values, `metres`, `kilograms` and `second` as explicit `Quantity`s with value `1`
   * - create some values by multiplying combinations of `Double`s and `metres`, `kilograms` and
   *   `seconds`
   * - let type inference work out the types; you can check them in Metals or by forcing a type mismatch
   * - define a method `circleArea` which takes a `radius` parameter
   * - define a new `UnitType` trait, `Yard` and a `yards` value
   * - create a new `Quantity` called `yardsPerMetre` with the value `1.09361` and appropriate units
   * - calculate the radius of a circle with radius 300 metres, and then convert the result into
   *   square yards
   * - implement some of Newton's equations of motion for uniform acceleration as methods; are they
   *   sound? (`https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equations_of_motion`)
   *
   * Currently, we create a new `Quantity` object for every value, including intermediate
   * expressions. Can we do better with opaque types? Try it!
   *
   * If opaque types work, check the bytecode that gets generated for some of these methods.
